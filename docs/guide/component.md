# Component

Baskito use [Vue.js v3](https://vuejs.org) for the components. so make sure you have learned about Vue.js before using Baskito.

In the latest version of Baskito, we introduce a new npm package called `@timedoor/baskito-ui` that contains all the components and utilities that you need to build a admin page. The components are integrated with [stisla](https://github.com/stisla/stisla) admin template.

You can see all of the available components in the [components page](/components/).
