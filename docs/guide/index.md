# What is Baskito?

Baskito stands for Backend Starter Kit Task Force, the main reason we made this project is to improve development time for the admin page with a standardized tech stack and components.

Baskito are built with [Laravel](https://laravel.com), [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com), [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org), and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). Baskito uses the [Stisla](https://github.com/stisla/stisla) template, which is a free Bootstrap 4 admin template. Also, Baskito provides several custom components that you can use to build your application.
